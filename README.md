# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Giving values to the point x1 and x2
### Step 2: 
Giving values to the points y1 and y2
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Calculating the distance using normal method to make the code simple
### Step 5: 
At last, print the distance value
### PROGRAM:
```

x1=10
x2=4
y1=6
y2=2
d=((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)**0.5
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
```
### OUTPUT:
